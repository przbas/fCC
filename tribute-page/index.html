            <h3>Here's a time line of Kotanski's life.</h3>
            <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item"><strong>1942</strong> Born in Warsaw during the Second World War, Marek Kotański's mother, Ludwika, was a painter. His father, Wiesław, was a Japanese language professor at Warsaw University. His house was open for everyone who needed help.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">From <strong>1960</strong> he studied psychology at Warsaw University. During his studies, he was active in the Ruch Młodych Wychowawców (Movement of Young Educators) who looked after orphans and young people affected by social problems.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">In <strong>1974</strong> Kotański was employed in the Psychiatric Hospital in Garwolin, which had a section for drug addicts (even though during that period, for ideological reasons, drug addicts did not exist). Knowing that traditional methods were not effective, he started a therapy group. </li>
                <li class="collection-item">The first Monar centre was opened on <strong>15 October 1978</strong> in Gloskow near Garwolin, starting in part of an abandoned house in ruins. Kotański started this program with a group or patients from the hospital in Garwolin. The results were better than expected. Now there are more than 157 Monar centres.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">From <strong>1985-1994</strong> Kotański organised the action "Łańcuch Czystych Serc" (Chain of Pure Hearts), where hundreds of thousands of young people joined hands in a chain stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Tatra mountains, symbolising unity for humanitarianism.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">In <strong>1993</strong> Kotański created Markot - Ruch Wychodzenia z Bezdomności (Movement Out of Homelessness), which involves about one hundred centres for homeless people, lone mothers with children, handicapped people, and the terminally ill.</li>
                <li class="collection-item"><strong>2002</strong> He died in a car accident in Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, near Warsaw.</li>
